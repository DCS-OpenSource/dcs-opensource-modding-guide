You build a .dll file which the game will load (when it is specified in the entry.lua). It defines functions which DCS will call to query information about the state of your plane. DCS will also call functions to pass you important information about the current state of your aircraft and the atmosphere. The rough outline of data flow is that DCS will first pass you information about your plane's state, then DCS will call your simulate function. Then DCS will ask you for information it requires like your engine RPM, or any forces or moments on the aircraft. Using this information DCS will then update your plane's acceleration, velocity and position (along with the angular equivalents of these). API Overview # DCS Reference Frames # DCS API defines two coordinate systems: global and local. Both of these are right handed coordinate systems defined as follows: +x -> forward +y -> up +z -> right Since this is a right handed coordinate system the rotations are more easily defined in terms of the body (local) coordinates as if flying the aircraft: +rotation around x -> roll right +rotation around y -> yaw left +rotation around z -> pitch up Local # This may also be known as body or aircraft body. This is the reference frame relative to the aircraft, as if you were flying along with the aircraft. The origin is defined from the centre of the model, note the centre of mass defined in the entry.lua is also defined from the origin of the model. +x -> forward torwards the nose +y -> up +z -> along out the right wing the rotations are the same as those described just above. Global # This refers to DCS's global or world coordinate system, this has no physical meaning this is just the underlying coordinate system used by the DCS engine, since DCS exists on a flat earth. The closest analogue to real coordinates local tangent plane coordinates for rotation (DCS is NUE). The DCS global frame is local tangent plane coordinates but also the position is absolute not relative to the aircraft position. In DCS the coordinates have the following meanings: +x -> north +y -> up +z -> east the rotations are the same as those described above, the only thing worth noting is the rotation around the y axis (yaw or heading) is positive to the left (west from north). This is the opposite of the normal convention of the compass starting at north and increasing eastward. This must be taken into account when using yaw angle for heading.

Then remove most of the mesh, leaving only one blade of the prop. This can vary depending on the type of prop, see two examples below. Ensure the prop has only one material, and the material name matches that of the props material in your main EDM, this will give your prop blur the same texture as your blades. Export this file as an .FBX file, and place the file in your shapes folder (or any mounted shape folder in your project), then move to the next step. Texturing advice # Note The below is from Mag3's 3D artist, who very kindly spilled the beans on how to make the blur look so good :-) Many factors involved really. The F4U has variable pitch blades, with a diameter of roughly 13 feet. Kind of gives that thickness look at all angles. Secondly, ensuring the same material applied in the EDM is identical to the FBX. PBR color values should correct too. For black, check in ModelViewer to see blue (push F8 function key) Except for weathering effects that may cause it to look blue, it needs to be closer to black or a deep dark blue for flat/dull coated objects. Using the HSB values, set it to 0*, 0%, 17% and go from there. If pink or orange, they need adjusted too. Pure colors should look grey (F8) in ModelViewer. Try to keep saturation away from 100%, and any 100% RGB values are not great for the shader. HSB, Orange: I recommend, 13 , 80%, 65% - 75%. It will look dark on texture, but that is ok. HSB, White: 0 , 0%, 65% - 74% Lastly, the collision model's Arg # for rotation should be 370 | 0...1 | 360*, while the main model is 407. Lua Setup # In your plane.lua , you need to define propellorShapeType and propellorShapeName as below O1_BirdDog = { Name = 'O-1E', DisplayName = _('O-1E Bird Dog'), Shape = \"O-1E\", propellorShapeType = \"3ARG_PROC_BLUR\", propellorShapeName = \"o1_blade.fbx\", Also be sure to define these fields in your SFM_Data/engine table: prop_direction = 1, -- pos rotates cw looking fwd neg is ccw prop_pitch_min = 26.0, -- prop pitch min, degrees prop_pitch_max = 82.0, -- prop pitch max, degrees prop_pitch_feather = 90.0, -- prop pitch feather position, degrees if feather < prop_pitch_max no feathering available prop_blades_count = 2, prop_locations = { {2.257, 0.03558, 0}, -- roll, yaw, pitch angle in tangent value }, 3ARG_PROC_BLUR # Note I haven't tested this with pitch, only a fixed pitch prop. The below references a blur sheet, I have not been able to get this in modelviewer, but you can test in game. 3ARG_PROC_BLUR expects three draw args in the model: Arg Function Description A RPM / Phase Drives rotation/blur amount B Blur Visibility / Blend Swaps blade \u2192 blur as RPM rises C Aux / Alpha Extra control for the blur sheet If those args don\u2019t exist or are stuck high in the EDM, you\u2019ll see a permanent disc. Quick checklist in ModelViewer (EDM): Confirm the prop uses 3 separate draw arguments. Spin RPM in the animation panel and check all three change. Ensure there is a static blade mesh and a blur sheet; the visibility of each is bound to those args (blade visible at low RPM, blur visible only above threshold). 2ARG_BLUR # If you only have a blur sheet (no static blades), it will always look like a disc at zero RPM. If you don\u2019t need the 3-arg system, switch to a simpler mode in Lua, e.g.: propellorShapeType = \"2ARG_BLUR\" \u2026and wire just two draw args in the EDM (static/blur). But the real fix is correcting the EDM arg bindings so 3ARG works. For AI-only aircraft where the prop is just for looks, the easiest is: propellorShapeType = \"static\" propellorShapeName = \"tbm_avenger_blade.FBX\" That way, DCS just draws the prop mesh as-is with no argument-driven blur. It\u2019ll look like a stationary prop at all times \u2014 no fake spin \u2014 but it avoids the \u201cperma-disc\u201d issue entirely. Use 1ARG_BLUR and bind it to any available dummy arg in shape_table_data (doesn\u2019t even need to move). Or keep it static and make a blurred texture for the mesh so it always looks like a \u201cmotion smear\u201d. If you want it to actually switch from blades \u2192 blur when spinning, you\u2019ll need to add two prop arguments in the EDM in ModelViewer / 3ds Max: One arg hides the static blades at speed. One arg shows the blur mesh at speed. That\u2019s the 2ARG_BLUR setup, and it\u2019s the simplest dynamic one DCS supports. EFM Setup # You will need to add the below code to your main cpp file with all your other ED_FM functions. Specifically inside ed_fm_get_param . Setting thse properly will get the prop blurring nicely switch (index) { case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_THRUST: // Thrust of engine in newtons, [N] return Prop.getThrust(); // case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_RELATED_THRUST: /// Related thrust in relation to \"max\" or also called \"dry thrust\" thrust of that engine // return ??? for now, idk what max thrust is right now; case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_RPM: // Engine Fan RPM (fan RPM for turbofan, propeller RPM for turboprop, etc.) case ED_FM_PROPELLER_1_RPM: // Propeller RPM, for helicopters this is main rotor RPM case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_CORE_RPM: // 0..RPMmax Engine and prop sound return Engine.getRPM(); case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_RELATED_RPM: // [0-1] return Engine.getRPMFraction(); case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_CORE_RELATED_RPM: // [0-1] displayed as RPM% in 2D F2 view return Engine.getRPMFraction(); case ED_FM_ENGINE_1_FAN_PHASE: // [0 - 2pi] Required to get the arg 407 to trigger the spin at low RPM return Prop.getFanPhase(); } Note See FM/wHumanCustomPhysicsAPI.h in the EFM API for more detailed descriptions of these.

For black, check in ModelViewer to see blue (push F8 function key) Except for weathering effects that may cause it to look blue, it needs to be closer to black or a deep dark blue for flat/dull coated objects. Using the HSB values, set it to 0*, 0%, 17% and go from there. If pink or orange, they need adjusted too. Pure colors should look grey (F8) in ModelViewer. Try to keep saturation away from 100%, and any 100% RGB values are not great for the shader. HSB, Orange: I recommend, 13 , 80%, 65% - 75%. It will look dark on texture, but that is ok. HSB, White: 0 , 0%, 65% - 74% Lastly, the collision model's Arg # for rotation should be 370 | 0...1 | 360*, while the main model is 407.","title":"Texturing advice"},{"location":"Aircraft/EFM/Useful_bits/prop_blur/#lua-setup","text":"In your plane.lua , you need to define propellorShapeType and propellorShapeName as below O1_BirdDog = { Name = 'O-1E', DisplayName = _('O-1E Bird Dog'), Shape = \"O-1E\", propellorShapeType = \"3ARG_PROC_BLUR\", propellorShapeName = \"o1_blade.fbx\", Also be sure to define these fields in your SFM_Data/engine table: prop_direction = 1, -- pos rotates cw looking fwd neg is ccw prop_pitch_min = 26.0, -- prop pitch min, degrees prop_pitch_max = 82.0, -- prop pitch max, degrees prop_pitch_feather = 90.0, -- prop pitch feather position, degrees if feather < prop_pitch_max no feathering available prop_blades_count = 2, prop_locations = { {2.257, 0.03558, 0}, -- roll, yaw, pitch angle in tangent value },","title":"Lua Setup"},{"location":"Aircraft/EFM/Useful_bits/prop_blur/#3arg_proc_blur","text":"Note I haven't tested this with pitch, only a fixed pitch prop.

Quick checklist in ModelViewer (EDM): Confirm the prop uses 3 separate draw arguments. Spin RPM in the animation panel and check all three change. Ensure there is a static blade mesh and a blur sheet; the visibility of each is bound to those args (blade visible at low RPM, blur visible only above threshold).","title":"3ARG_PROC_BLUR"},{"location":"Aircraft/EFM/Useful_bits/prop_blur/#2arg_blur","text":"If you only have a blur sheet (no static blades), it will always look like a disc at zero RPM. If you don\u2019t need the 3-arg system, switch to a simpler mode in Lua, e.g.: propellorShapeType = \"2ARG_BLUR\" \u2026and wire just two draw args in the EDM (static/blur). But the real fix is correcting the EDM arg bindings so 3ARG works. For AI-only aircraft where the prop is just for looks, the easiest is: propellorShapeType = \"static\" propellorShapeName = \"tbm_avenger_blade.FBX\" That way, DCS just draws the prop mesh as-is with no argument-driven blur. It\u2019ll look like a stationary prop at all times \u2014 no fake spin \u2014 but it avoids the \u201cperma-disc\u201d issue entirely. Use 1ARG_BLUR and bind it to any available dummy arg in shape_table_data (doesn\u2019t even need to move). Or keep it static and make a blurred texture for the mesh so it always looks like a \u201cmotion smear\u201d. If you want it to actually switch from blades \u2192 blur when spinning, you\u2019ll need to add two prop arguments in the EDM in ModelViewer / 3ds Max: One arg hides the static blades at speed. One arg shows the blur mesh at speed.
