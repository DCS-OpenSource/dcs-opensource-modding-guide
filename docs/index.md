# DCS Modding Docs

Welcome to the **DCS OpenSource Community’s** combined knowledge base!  
This documentation is not intended to be a complete guide for making a mod from scratch.  
Instead, it serves as a **lookup and reference** for the many functions and systems that DCS provides to modders.  

The document is **living and evolving** — new discoveries, functions, and best practices will be added as we learns more.  

---

## Disclaimer
Not all functions have been fully tested.  
If you encounter errors, unexpected behavior, or missing information, please let the team know so we can improve the documentation together.

Untested functions will have the **[[UNVERIFIED]]** tag next to them, while they exist, we currently cannot guarantee the functionality is as expected.

---

## What You’ll Find Here
- Reference for common DCS modding functions  
- Notes on scripting with Lua and device definitions  
- Examples of aircraft system implementations  
- Tips, tricks, and gotchas from the community  

This isn’t a tutorial — it’s a **toolbox** for mod developers.
