## Editing your Fork

You can make any normal changes as if it were your repository. If you know how to use git you can clone your fork and edit it locally. If you don't you can edit directly on the github page and it will provide nice markdown previews.

## Pull Request

Once you have changes on your fork you can submit a pull request to have these changes merged back to the main repository.
