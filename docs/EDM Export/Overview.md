# Eagle Dynamics DCS Blender Export Plugin

## Intro
I've compiled this documentation since the docs included with the plugin in the manual folder are out of date, and complete, with poor formatting.  
However the template EDM files are very useful.

!!! Note
    There are no changelogs or any public info about this other than what is included in the downloaded .zip

!!! Warning
    This guide assumes general blender knowledge, including materials, animation.

## Installation
The Blender plugin can be downloaded from [here](https://mods.eagle.ru/blender_plugin/files.html)

Install the .zip file into blender in edit > preferences.

!!! Note
    At time of writing, the plugin has not been updated since March 11 2025.  
    The plugin is still work in progress, and some features will not work.
