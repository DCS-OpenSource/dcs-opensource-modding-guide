# Eagle Dynamics DCS Blender Export Plugin

## Introduction
This documentation was compiled because the official docs included with the plugin (in the `manual` folder) are outdated, incomplete, and poorly formatted.  
That said, the **template EDM files** provided are still very useful.

!!! note
    There are no changelogs or public information about this plugin other than what is included in the downloaded `.zip`.  
    **The plugin is still a work in progress, and some features will not function.**

!!! warning
    This guide assumes general Blender knowledge, including familiarity with **materials** and **animation**.
