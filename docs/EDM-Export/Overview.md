# Eagle Dynamics DCS Blender Export Plugin

## Introduction
This documentation was compiled because the official docs included with the plugin (in the `manual` folder) are outdated, incomplete, and poorly formatted.  
That said, the **template EDM files** provided are still very useful.

!!! note
    There are no changelogs or public information about this plugin other than what is included in the downloaded `.zip`.  
    **The plugin is still a work in progress, and some features will not function.**

!!! warning
    This guide assumes general Blender knowledge, including familiarity with **materials** and **animation**.

## Supported Blender Versions

- ✅ Works on **Blender `4.2.3 LTS`**
- ⚠️ Appears to work on **Blender `3.6.0 LTS`**, but not personally verified
- ❌ Does **NOT** work on **Blender `4.5.0 LTS`**  
  (Blender updated the materials API. Code changes suggest future support is planned.)
